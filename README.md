In this repository i created a generalized header file of data structure using STL in c++. 
A header file for a data structure typically contains declarations of classes, functions, and variables related to that data structure. This separation of declaration and implementation allows for modular programming, where the implementation details are hidden from users who only need to know how to use the data structure, not how it's implemented.
